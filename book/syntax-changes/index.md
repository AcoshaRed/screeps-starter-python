If there is anything else you've found, do file an issue in the screeps-starter-python repository and I will include it here. Transcrypt uses the Python interpreter itself to parse source code, but it doesn't replicate the python runtime perfectly. When in doubt, looking at the created `main.js` file can provide a lot of insight into how things run.
